# Exchange Sort Function for Array

## Background
The exchange sort is a simple algorithm that can be implemented to iterate through all unique pairs of array indexes and exchange the values in those position if the value 
in the first index (alpha) is less than the second index (beta) until all elements are sorted in descending order.



## Directions
Complete the given template file <b>lab17.cpp</b> by defining a function named <b>findHigh</b> that is designed to accept an array reference pointer, 
value paramter for the size, reference parameter to store the index, and a reference parameter to store the high value. The function must search through the array that is
passed to find the largest value and it's index position and return them to the calling function to be printed. Note: You will need to use function overloading with function 
signatures to handle char arrays, string arrays, integer arrays, and double arrays. 

## Example Arrays to be Processed
<pre>double fpData[] = {76.25, 85.45, -45.90, 99.34,-44.12, 45.75, 57.77, 108.45, 65.64, 77.21, -24, 62};
int intData[] = {35, 45, 55, 20, 30, 50};
string stringData[] = {"Apple", "apple1", "apple10", "apples", "apple", "1apple"};
char charData[] = {'e', 'a', '3', 'K', 'z', '*', ';', 'Z' };</pre>

## Interface Prototype Example

### Test Case Output
<pre><b>The highest value is at index 7 and is 108.45
The highest value is at index 2 and is 55
The highest value is at index 3 and is apples
The highest value is at index 4 and is z</b></pre>
